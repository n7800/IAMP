# InstallAware (Multi Platform) 2025

_Install Aware 2025_ is a cross-platform tool for application developers looking to self-publish (and update) their software on _Windows_, _macOS_, and _Linux_. It builds native code, fully self-contained setup programs that run without requiring any libraries or dependencies. _Apple Intel_, _Apple Silicon_, _Linux GTK2_, _Linux Qt5_, _Linux aarch64_, _Linux x86_64_, and _Windows_ are all supported from a single source - driven by a free-flowing setup script that dynamically adapts to the underlying operating system. The setup wizard dialogs are fully editable as well (using an editor just like _Lazarus_' own), and they look and feel the same on each supported platform.

* Easily jumpstart a setup project using the _Quick Start Wizard_ or any of the extensive template/sample projects. Remember, one source deploys everywhere!
* Import any existing setup you built (up to 21 years ago) in _InstallAware_ for _Windows Installer_, and recompile it for _macOS_ and/or _Linux_ - retaining all of your custom script logic and dialogs - in literally a single click.
* Just like its closed source sibling, _InstallAware (Multi Platform) 2025_ supports _Partial Web Deployment_, fully customizable _Web Updates_, command line builds, advanced _Setup Capture_ (snapshot based - works by monitoring the changes an application/installer makes to the system), and localizations. If you've used _InstallAware_ before, you'll find everything exactly where you expect them to be. Everything works exactly the same way you're used to from before.
* Each of these tools are implemented entirely as native code on each platform, just like the setup engine itself; with everything coded 100% in _Lazarus_, and sources fully published.
* _InstallAware_ is so advanced, in the rare instances where _Linux_ widget support is missing, it renders customized dialogs in pure character mode - ensuring 100% successful payload delivery on even the most locked down of environments. The character mode setup engine is available for _Windows_ and _macOS_, too.
